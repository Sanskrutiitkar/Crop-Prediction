As we know the fact that, India is the second largest population country in the world 
and majority of people in India have agriculture as their occupation. 
Farmers are growing same crops repeatedly without trying new verity of crops.
</li>
 <li>
This is directly affecting on crop yield so, we have designed the system using machine learning algorithms for betterment of farmers. 
Our system will suggest the best suitable crop for particular land based on content and weather parameters. 
</li>
<li>
Agriculture growth is infulenced by a variety of soil parameters such as nitrogen,phosphorus and potassium as well as soil moisture, 
climatic factors such as temprature and rainfall our webiste will benifit agriculture by increasing crop productivity 
</li>
<li>
Using Machine Learning it is possible to anticipate the most suited crop based on current environmental circumstances
